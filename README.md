## Neural Network
This is a framework of Neural Network for myself. This framework could implement ordinary neural network and convolution neural network.
# Autoencoder example
In example.py file, I demostrate autoencoder based on the MNIST dataset. We could
see that as the number of iteration goes up, the loss would go down. Also the reconstruction
would be clearer if the number of iteration is larger. The following graph is the loss and the
MNIST original images versus the reconstructed ones.
